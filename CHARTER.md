# Application & Tools Software Horizontal Committee Charter

Application & Tools Software Horizontal Committee aims to make RISC-V the premier platform for software developers and innovators.  To this goal, it ensures that RISC-V standards efforts align with the needs of the wider software ecosystem, nurtures a vivid software ecosystem for RISC-V, and drives a software-driven evolution of the RISC-V standards.

It develops the strategy, does gap analysis, and provides governance for efforts to enable specific application domains (such as AI/ML), toolchains, runtime libraries, and application performance. The scope includes (but not limited to) Linux-class and embedded operating systems, compilers, debuggers, profilers, linkers, ABIs, managed runtimes, virtual machines, containers, and target specific libraries (like HPC or AI/ML/NLP).

The special interest groups (SIGs) and task groups (TGs) operating under the Application & Tools Software Horizontal Committee aim to initiate new standardisation efforts, develop specifications, and influence existing efforts governed by other committees to ensure that both the ISA and ecosystem provide a robust foundation for products, services, and solutions built on RISC-V.
