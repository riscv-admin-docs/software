# Application & Tools Software Horizontal Committee Charter

The Application & Tools Software Horizontal committee nurtures the creation of a dynamic
RISC-V software ecosystem to make RISC-V the platform of choice for
software developers and innovators.  It develops the strategy, does
gap analysis, and governs subcommittees dedicated to platforms,
toolchains, and runtimes. This includes (but not limited to)
Linux-class and embedded operating systems, compilers, debuggers,
profilers, linkers, ABIs, managed runtimes, virtual machines,
containers, and target specific libraries (like HPC or AI/ML/NLP).
The committee will also help its subcommittees create special
interest groups and task groups or influence task groups governed
by other committees to ensure that both the ISA and ecosystem provide
a robust foundation for products, services, and solutions for RISC-V.
This committee also governs the development of RISC-V Platforms
(which simplifies the life of ISVs by defining common and interoperable
target platforms) so that a wide variety of application and system
developers can have the same target and not diverge between
implementations.
